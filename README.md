# Timestamps Converter
An app that makes timestamp adjustment easy for creators who repurpose their content across various platforms.

## Target Audience
Content creators (podcasters, for example) who need to publish the same content with different intro/outro sequences or Advertisements across various platforms.

## Problem Addressed
Manually adjusting timestamps is a tedious process. Most solutions that currently exist require each timestamp to be adjusted manually. This approach is not feasible when there are multiple timestamps to be adjusted, which is usually the case for a 1 hour podcast recording.

--- 
## Goal
Working to implement two ways of usage
1. User manually inputs how much time needs to be added or subtracted from the original timestamps
2. User inputs the first timestamp from the primary content and its matching timestamp from the secondary content, and the app does time addition/subtraction calculation.

## Progress
* Basic logic implementations are complete
* Need to work on making the app mobile-friendly
